    <h1>Dogs</h1>
    <p>Dogs tend to work together to get things done, so your dog will involve himself in your routines as a way to connect with you.
        Dogs are much easier to train than cats. They're pack animals, which means that their instincts encourage them to follow what their leader.
        dog is active and playful. While he may take an occasional nap, he prefers being at your side.</p>

    <p>Cats are solitary hunters. They are very independent creatures, and often don't rely on their humans for much past their basic needs of food and a clean litter box.
        Cats can be just as affectionate and snuggly as dogs, they can also be just as loud and irritating after a long day.
        A cat, on the other hand, sleeps away much of the daylight hours, preferring to jump into turbo time right before you jump into bed. Cats are more playful in the evenings, but there are many cats who make time for their pet parents during the day. A routine helps get your cat more on your schedule.
