    <h1>Dogs</h1>
    <p>Dogs tend to work together to get things done, so your dog will involve himself in your routines as a way to connect with you.
        Dogs are much easier to train than cats. They're pack animals, which means that their instincts encourage them to follow what their leader.
        dog is active and playful. While he may take an occasional nap, he prefers being at your side.</p>
